Pixels
======

Know the pixels you see. A lazy Sunday afternoon hack.

Captures pixels on your screen sequentially, and draws them out in a single image!

Usage
======

Change the global variables `X`, `WIDTH` and `HEIGHT` as per your needs.

    python pixels.py
    
Dependencies
===========

[PIL](http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm)

Notes
=======

I set `WIDTH = 100` and `HEIGHT = 100` while developing, and it took about 19 minutes to complete with no sleep interval (`X = 0`). Time to complete increases quadratically. Just a heads up.
